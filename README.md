# What is Greener?

Greener is a set of guidance and practices to help software engineers build
greener software. It can be broken down into:

-   **Greener Engineering** – Guidance on greener software and cloud engineering
    practices

-   **Greener Conversations** – Guidance on how to broker conversations about
    greener software engineering with stakeholders and teams

-   **Greener Backlog** – A backlog to track, manage, and frame greener software
    engineering practices on your projects

The path to greener software engineering takes time, and maybe starting with
some easier areas first is the right step. Or possibly you are looking to try
everything on your next project. But where to start? How can you plan?

Nothing happens by accident, and green engineering practices need a plan the
same as everything else on a software engineering project. Having a managed
backlog helps you track what tasks are in scope, what is remaining, or what was
deemed out of scope.

The Greener Backlog is your starting point for this. Designed to be easily
imported into any project, it is your backlog to evolve and change to fit your
needs on your own projects.
